# TREASURE ISLADE

**TREASURE ISLADE** is a simple text-based adventure game created in Python. In this game, you navigate through a series of choices to find a hidden treasure. Each decision you make will impact the outcome of the game, so choose wisely!

## Project Overview

This project was designed as a fun way to practice Python programming and control flow logic using conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`). The game provides an interactive experience where players must make a series of choices that lead to different scenarios and endings.

## How the Game Works

1. The game starts by welcoming the player with ASCII art and a brief introduction.
2. Players are prompted to make choices at each level, guiding them through various scenarios.
3. Depending on the player's choices, they will either advance to the next level or face an end to their adventure.

### Game Structure

- **Level 1**: Choose the direction to start your journey (`left` or `right`).
- **Level 2**: Decide how to navigate a dark hall (`ask` for a way out or `take` a torch).
- **Level 3**: Choose how to cross a river (`swim` or `wait` for a boat).
- **Level 4**: Pick the correct door on the island to find the treasure (`red`, `yellow`, or `green`).

### Possible Endings

- Find the treasure and win the game.
- Encounter various obstacles that will end your journey (falling into a hole, getting bitten by a snake, entering dangerous rooms, etc.).

## Key Features

- **Interactive Storytelling**: The game provides a narrative where each choice affects the outcome.
- **User Input**: Players interact with the game by typing their choices, making it a simple yet engaging experience.
- **Multiple Endings**: The game offers different endings based on player decisions, encouraging multiple playthroughs.
